Quiver.js FAQ
=============

### Is Quiver.js a web framework?

Quiver.js is _not_ a web framework, but you can build one on top of it. Quiver.js do not provide any library for opinionated-features that typical frameworks provide, such as database or user management. You will have to build those features as quiver components on top of Quiver.js, but with Quiver.js's help you can produce flexible and modular code that exactly suite your needs.
